# Flow Reconstruction

This project demonstrates flow-field reconstruction using diffusion-based methods. From left to right, the visualization shows the input field, the reconstructed output, and the ground-truth flow.

To assess generalization to out-of-distribution data, the model was evaluated on 256×256 tasks using only 1.5625% of the input information.
